### Creating a child branch

CB = "When working in groups, creating a branch is important so different people can make changes and contributions to the project work. Steps include:
Step (1) Once the child branch is created, the editions and contributions can be made into the child branch without affecting the main work.
Step (2) A pull request is then made so the group members can review your contributions or changes before merging.
Step (3) Once review is done, the child branch willl be merged with the main branch, and the child branch can then be deleted."
